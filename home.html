            <p id="PHome">Fontaines D.C. is one of the newest bands that has had a great breakthrough in popularity - combining
            aesthetics of rock, <br> post-punk and even club music it is truly a breath of fresh air in the music scene. The band, 
            consisting of Grian Chatten <br> (vocals), Carlos O'Connell (guitar), Conor Curley (guitar), Conor Deegan III (bass), 
            and Tom Coll (drums) has a style <br> of instrumentation and specific vocal use, as well as unique, almost poetic lyrics
            to some of their songs, that harkens back <br> to the great post-punk bands of old -
            mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division">Joy Division</a>. Their songs have great variation
            among them - loud or <br> melancholic,  fast or slow in tempo, having great interplay among the more traditional sounding 
            electric guitars and drums <br> or employing synthesizers in their soon to be released album "Skinty Fia".

            <div id="PHome" class="grid-item1"><p>In their debut album's first song - "Big" the leading man Grian Chatten expresses himself <br>
                thusly: "My childhood while small but I'm gonna be big". However crude their first album <br> was (which should be expected for a 
                band that plays music in their genre) these words might <br> still come true - their second album, "A Hero's Death" was nominated
                for album of the year <br> at the Grammy awards and thus far has been their highest achievement.  </p></div>
